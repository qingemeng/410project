You're not allowed to iterate through a set that you're removing elements from.\\nnext(iter(s)) is also OK and I tend to think it reads better. Also, you can use a sentinel to handle the case when s is empty. E.g. next(iter(s), set()).\\nThis answers my question. Alas, I guess I will still use pop(), since iteration seems to sort the elements. I would prefer them in random order...\\n+1 `iter(s).next()` is not gross but great. Completely general to take arbitrary element from any iterable object. Your choice if you want to be careful if the collection is empty though.</td>\n",

That's what I was trying to say in the first paragraph of this post. Back then (6 years ago) there wasn't a more effective way to do this using Django ORM.

       "0  Hi Kevin, I tried the latter code and it worked great. Plus I get the idea now of how this loop thing actually works (or at least I am getting there) I don't know why I had trouble figuring out the loop concept with the design, but not with the colors...Anyways I really do appreciate the help.I actually had to drop this class last semester, and I really need to pass it this time around. My specialty is not programming. I am a specialist at Maya and 3DS MAX modeling, texturing, and animation. That stuff I know, this stuff I have trouble with:(...Thanks again Kevin:)                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "2  `next(iter(your_list or []), None)` to handle None sets and empty sets\\n@highBandWidth: I think python will raise an error if you do that. You're not allowed to iterate through a set that you're removing elements from.\\nnext(iter(s)) is also OK and I tend to think it reads better. Also, you can use a sentinel to handle the case when s is empty. E.g. next(iter(s), set()).\\nThis answers my question. Alas, I guess I will still use pop(), since iteration seems to sort the elements. I would prefer them in random order...\\n+1 `iter(s).next()` is not gross but great. Completely general to take arbitrary element from any iterable object. Your choice if you want to be careful if the collection is empty though.                                                            \n",
       "3  Thanks. Note that in the example you gave, the order was ascending (in other words \"the lower the score, the higher the ranking\"), so I went with it. If higher score should actually increase the ranking you should change \"score__lt\" to \"score__gt\".\\nThank you, that's exactly what I was looking for.\\nThis should be computationally expensive, as it will run the ranking aggregate query for each row in `Model.objects.all()`\\n@mehmet Yes, of course. That's what I was trying to say in the first paragraph of this post. Back then (6 years ago) there wasn't a more effective way to do this using Django ORM. Nowadays there might be a PostgreSQL only solution using PostgreSQL window functions and a custom annotate function. I might look into that when I have more time.   \n",
